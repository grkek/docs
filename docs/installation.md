# Installation

### Install Crystal
Crystal is a language for humans and computers. 

Crystal is a type safe, compiled language inspired by the simplicity of Ruby. Type safety means more errors are caught by the compiler during development, so you can be more confident about your code working in production.

See [https://crystal-lang.org/install/](https://crystal-lang.org/install) to install Crystal.
